I'm using YAML in another project, and I originally thought I'd just
put some snippets together.

But I wound up doing a number of short tests to see what the basic
yaml module in Python thinks. As this is getting a bit long to be a
gist, I'm just putting it up in a repo.

I'm using yaml_mode in emacs to edit; it's reasonably good, but
doesn't give you much help.

I've also done a few tests with Perl; if you have YAML::XS, try:

cat | perl -MYAML::XS -MData::Dumper -e 'print Dumper(Load(join("", <STDIN>)))'

Or install ysh from libyaml-shell-perl on debian derived systems.
